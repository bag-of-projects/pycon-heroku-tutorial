Setup and Installation
======================

Before you arrive at the workshop, try to have your local development environment setup.

Python 2.7
++++++++++

If you don't have Python setup on your local development machine, you'll need to do that before the workshop.

http://install.python-guide.org/

Once complete, the `python`, `python27`, `pip`, and `virtualenv` commands will be available.


Heroku Toolbelt
++++++++++++++++

Next, you'll need to install the Heroku Toolbelt:

http://toolbelt.heroku.com/

Once complete, the `heroku`, `git`, and `foreman` commands will be available.
