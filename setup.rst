Setup and Installation
======================

Before you arrive at the workshop, try to have your local development environment setup.

Python 2.7
++++++++++

First, you'll need to have Python, Pip, and Virtualenv installed. We'll be using Python 2.7 for the tutorial.

Here is a step-by-step instruction guide:

  http://install.python-guide.org/

Once complete, the ``python``, ``python27``, ``pip``, and ``virtualenv`` commands will be available.


Heroku Toolbelt
++++++++++++++++

Next, you'll also need to install the Heroku Toolbelt:

http://toolbelt.heroku.com/

Once complete, the ``heroku``, ``git``, and ``foreman`` commands will be available.
